# Task - Maths with dictionary elements

You're given two dictionaries. Both have the same keys `a`, `b`, `c` with their values being random numbers. You need to multiply the values with the same key value in the other dict and sum all results.

```
dict1 = {
  'a': 4,
  'b': 16,
  'c': 3
}

dict2 = {
  'a': 8,
  'b': 2,
  'c': 3
}
```

## Output:
